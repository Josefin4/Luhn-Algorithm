# Luhn-Algorithm
This command line app takes an input of numbers (of any length) and performs a checksum on the last digit by using the Luhn Algorithm.
It displays:
    - The full user input, with the check digit separated
    - A comparison of the provided check digit compared to the expected (calculated) check digit
    - A clear output of valid or invalid for the user input
    - It must indicate if the solution is long enough to be a credit card number (16 digits)
    
The application also consists of 10 JUnit tests.
